Really enjoyed watching [Chappie (2015)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1823672/) last
night.
It's the third movie from Neill Blomkamp, the director of [District 9 (2009)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1136608/)
and [Elysium (2013)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535108/). RoboCop meets District 9.

Okay, Elysium could be better, but I got a serious kick out of District 9 and
Chappie was right up my alley. The story is set in Johannesburg
that looks eerie as it is. To sum it up without giving too much of the plot away
let me say that the gang of small-caliber criminals are tricking a self-concious
robot into the life of crime. Abandoned buildings, crime, poverty and luxury are mixed up in the melting pot
of South Africa. Throw in some police robots and you get the idea.

  The Vodacom building in Johannesburg was already deserted in 2006 and apparently not in a better condition now.

With the addition of Die Antwoord who are playing a somewhat altered version of
themselves things started to feel simply surreal. Unfortunately apart from the
Die Antwoord duo and the guy playing Hippo other characters looked like they
got in Johannesburg by mistake. Enough with being picky though, despite the
miscasts and occasional plot holes I could not get my eyes off the screen.

If you liked the original [RoboCop (1987)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093870/)
– Chappie is going to strike similar chords. Another movie that comes to mind
and relatively unknown these days is
[Short Circut (1986)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/) – I was so impressed
when I was a kid I've watched it seven times in the movies.

Okay back then they didn't make Jonny Five or Alex Murphy rob other people and wear bling,
so expect a different kind of entertainment here. Gangsta-style with the required plot
devices preserved: Good robot – check, Big bad robot – check, thugs, gangs – oh yeah.

Wish I could watch it with kids, but the degree of f-word usage and some graphic
scenes near the last third of the movie makes it not very family-friendly.
My wife didn't like it at all:

> — I don't want to watch it, they are being mean to the robot

Too bad the [RoboCop (2015)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1234721/) remake turned
out pretty bland in comparison to the original. Like a direct-to-video sequel
that were released in abundance in the 90s. Chappie kicks some serious ass.

Oh and if you like retro-fitted dystopian robotic future, check out
[Edge of Tomorrow (2014)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867/) that one is
kids-friendly even.

And I am off to seeing District 9 again.
