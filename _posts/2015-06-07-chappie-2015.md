Really enjoyed watching [Chappie (2015)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1823672/) last
night.
It's the third movie from Neill Blomkamp, the director of [District 9 (2009)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1136608/)
and [Elysium (2013)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535108/).  

Okay, Elysium could be better, but I got a serious kick out of District 9 and
Chappie was right up my alley. The story is set in Johannesburg
that looks eerie as it is. To sum it up without giving too much of the plot away
let me say that the gang of small-caliber criminals are tricking a self-concious
robot into the life of crime. Abandoned buildings, crime, poverty and luxury are mixed up in the melting pot
of South Africa. Throw in some police robots and you get the idea.

With the addition of Die Antwoord who are playing themselves the things are
starting to feel simply surreal. Too bad that apart from Die Antwoord and the
guy playing Hippo everybody else
were looking like they got in Johannesburg by mistake. Dev Patel, Sigourney Weaver? Oh come on.
Hugh Jackman was not very convincing with his imitation of south-african accent either.
Enough with being picky though, despite the miscasts and plot holes I couldn't get my eyes off the screen.

If you liked the original [Robocop (1987)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093870/)
– Chappie strikes similar chords.
Okay they didn't make Alex Murphy robbing other people and wear bling-bling,
so expect a different kind of entertainment here. However the needed plot devices are present:
Good robot – check, Big bad robot – check, thugs, gangs – oh yeah.

Wish I could watch it with kids, but the degree of f-word usage and some graphic
scenes near the last third of the movie makes it not very family-friendly.
My wife didn't like it at all:
> "I don't want to watch it, they are being mean to the robot"

Too bad the [Robocop (2015)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1234721/) remake turned
out pretty bland in comparison to the original. Like a direct-to-video sequel
that were released in abundance in the 90s. Chappie kicks some serious ass.

Oh and if you like retro-fitted dystopian robotic future, check out
[Edge of Tomorrow (2014)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867/) that one is
kids-friendly even.

And I am off to seeing District 9 again.
