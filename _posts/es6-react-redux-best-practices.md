Here are some of my personal insights from almost a year writing React
full-time. I am being asked to share the knowledge so here it is. Everything
is subjective, what works for me doesn't have to work for you.

## Use ES6/ES7 syntax

If you are still writing JavaScript as it was intended or CoffeeScript -- stop.
`const`
Arrow functions
Good parts of js

## ESLint everything

## Use Objects
Object.entries

## Spread all the things

## Crush, Kill, Destructure!

Pass objects and get the keys where needed
Don't change names
Don't create variables

## Simple React
Stateless components
setState is a code smell
Don't pass extra props
isRequired everything

## Use Redux
Or maybe MobX?

## Less folders

## Re-export

## Test everything
SkinDeep
Redux

## Don't stop

ES7 is around the bend, Webpack 2 is released, GraphQL, Relay...
