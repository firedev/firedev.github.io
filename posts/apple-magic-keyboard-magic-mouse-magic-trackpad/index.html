    <p>Keyboard is great. Mouse is good. Trackpad is okay.</p>

<p>Now for the longer version. I am living in Thailand and it was really easy to
order Apple products until they have removed the English version from their
website. Now it’s all a mess but I got through somehow. Strictly for the sake
of posting the review.</p>

<p>This is what it looked like:</p>

<div style="#e6e6e6">
<img class="block md-col-8" src="/images/posts/store-apple-com.png" alt="store.apple.com" />
</div>

<h2 id="magic-keyboard">Magic Keyboard</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/magic-keyboard.jpg" alt="Magic Keyboard" /></p>

<p>Let me put it this way. If you are typing all day, get up
and get one of these. Skip the rest of the page.</p>

<p>I like Apple Wired Keyboard with the additional numeric pad. Used one with Mac
Mini back in the days when I just switched to Mac. After the first generation
of Wireless keyboards was released I was quickly annoyed that they were using
3xAA batteries. If you buy batteries in packs of four, there is always an extra
one is lying around.</p>

<p>After a couple of years Apple released 2-battery Wireless Keyboard, which made
it a little bit more bearable. But having a keyboard is only half of the deal.
You have to power it somehow. Buying a box of batteries to throw a handful away
every week or two is not something I liked neither from economical nor
ecological point of view. Plus they die when you least expect it and you don’t
have spare batteries.</p>

<p>So I started to buy chargers and rechargeable batteries. I tried them all:
Duracell, Energizer, Apple, you name it. To my surprise they’re all crap. Apple
Chargers and Apple Batteries turned out to be the worst. I thought they are
going to last at least, but those were the ones to die first. I had two sets I
think. One charger died right away, another one is blinking its amber light not
doing anything. The batteries started to leak and get puffed after a while.
Maybe this is why they were pulled off quickly.</p>

<p>And to tell you the truth these keyboards were not very pleasant to type on.
Okay, they are better than the most keyboards you buy. But compared to Macbooks
they were too … “springy” (if there is such word). You have to press harder,
keys travel longer distance, there is more resistance. In the end I got some
pains in both hands and even tried some DIY anti-RSI measures that didn’t
improve the situation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/diy-anti-rsi-keyboard.jpg" alt="DIY Anti-RSI Keyboard" /></p>

<p>So the new keyboard was something I was eagerly waiting for to become available in
Thailand and ordered one the same day it got approved by the local FCC.</p>

<p>That was a right move. Magic Keyboard is flatter, leaner and a pleasure to type
on. It produces a bit more noise but that is okay. It feels pretty much as
Macbook Air keyboard which is perfect in my book. In fact after typing on the
Magic Keyboard for about a week Macbook Pro keyboard feels too soft now.
And these wobbly keys, yuck. Something I have never noticed before.</p>

<p>To sum it up I am very pleased with the new Magic Keyboard and can recommend it
without hesitation.</p>

<h2 id="magic-mouse-2">Magic Mouse 2</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/magic-mouse-2.jpg" alt="Magic Mouse 2" /></p>

<p>The first Magic Mouse was very nice except two things.</p>

<p>Batteries inside weren’t connected securely enough and the mouse tend to
disconnect from a slight shakes. So when you were working on some intricate
piece of Photoshop and every time you lift the mouse to reposition it on the
table you had to be very careful to not hit the table too hard or the Mouse
would disconnect for a moment.</p>

<p>The mouse “feet”, it has these two plastic rails on it’s belly, got shaved off
after excessive use so its belly was scratching the desk with unpleasant sound.
And in the end I tended to use it less and less.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the mouse lovers now we have an improved version you don’t have
to feed batteries to. Built-in accumulators so you can shake it all you want.
And the plastic “feet” got a bit higher, plus there is no hatch on the bottom
so nothing is wobbling and so far it does not seem to touch the table where it
is not supposed to. Unfortunately sometimes you are bound to scratch the desk
with the aluminum body. This is simply unavoidable unless you are very careful.</p>

<p>So all in all it is a good replacement, especially if you liked Magic Mouse
version one.</p>

<h2 id="magic-trackpad-2">Magic Trackpad 2</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/magic-trackpad-2.jpg" alt="Magic Trackpad 2" /></p>

<p>The trackpad is a new beast and comes with Force Touch. Where do I start? The
body now flatter and shaped just like the new keyboard. The old Magic Trackpad
used micro-switches in it’s feet so you couldn’t use it on soft surfaces
without having tap-to-click enabled. The new one doesn’t have moving parts at
all (there is a power switch though). So theoretically it could be used for
couch surfing or controlling the new Apple TV, but I didn’t try either.</p>

<p>It mimics the click with a short burst of force feedback that feels as you were
actually clicking. Good job here, hands down. It can also produce the clicking
sound which I turned off in preferences right away.</p>

<p>Sadly, after playing with Force Touch for a few days I had to turn it off as
well. At least for now it is quite useless. Yes, you can press harder on the
face of someone you don’t like on Internet. Preview or rename files and do some
other stuff here and there with deeper press. But it all seemed gimmicky and
not really supported anywhere outside of Apple’s own applications. Plus it hits
you off-balance when you are dragging something for a longer distance and
accidentally hitting the “second base” from time to time. Did I even pressed it
hard enough before that?</p>

<p>The other nitpick is that you can’t really reliably press on the very edge of
the trackpad which I found myself doing from time to time.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong though. It is great and it’s like 1.5 times bigger than the
old one. To my own surprise I found myself using Trackpad almost exclusively
<a href="http://firedev.com/posts/mac-as-ide/">when I get hands off keyboard</a>.
Don’t think I ever reached for the mouse lately at all.</p>

<p>It costs almost as much as the new keyboard AND the new mouse combined.
Keep that in mind if you are thinking about adding it to your arsenal. I am
sure the developers will come up with some nice ideas on how to utilize Force
Touch in the upcoming year.</p>

<p>Right now it’s just what it is: good expensive touchpad.</p>

<h2 id="lightning">Lightning</h2>

<p>Another thing I didn’t mention is how the devices are being paired now. You
plug it in. And it just works. Whoa!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/keyboard-ready-to-use.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is a refreshing change after fiddling with Bluetooth pairing for the
previous generation of devices. And as a nice bonus now I have three new
Lightning cables that are known to die left and right. Wish Apple switched to
USB-C across the board though.</p>

<p>So the bottom line is: Get the Keyboard if you do a lot of typing.
The other accessories is something for you to decide if you need them or not.</p>
