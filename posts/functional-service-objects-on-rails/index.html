    <p>An excellent talk “Blending Functional and OO Programming in Ruby” given by
Piotr Solnica on Full Stack Fest 2015 made me think about improving current
practices. I have tried different ways of organizing my service objects and
here is what I came up with.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The idea is to switch from Object Oriented mentality and stateful objects to
more functional way of doing things when only data is passed through your
system.</p>

<p>I am working on this motivational portal. Let’s use a concept from the project
for the sake of the example. The models involved in this example are <code>User</code>,
  <code>Motivation</code>, <code>Shop</code> and <code>Role</code>.</p>

<p><code>Motivation</code> is some data that defines <code>Shop</code> to which <code>User</code> has access to in
a given month and his <code>Role</code> in regards to that. Each month a <code>User</code> can be
assigned to different <code>Shops</code> and different <code>Roles</code>. Say, an employee this
month and shop manager the next month. I call such managers “chief” since
manager was already taken.</p>

<h2 id="stuff-everything-into-model">Stuff everything into model</h2>

<p>For current month we need to get the list of shops user can manage. And to do
that we have to use multiple tables as there a certain roles that carry “chief”
ability. The most obvious solution is to stuff everything into User model.
So without further ado:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  def chief_shops_for_month(month)
    shops.merge(
      motivations.for_month(month).where(role_id: Role.chief)
    ).uniq
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Invocation is simple:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">shops = user.chief_shops_for_month(month)
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm, that starts quite harmless. But what if we measure complexity with flog?</p>

<pre><code>    10.0: flog total
    10.0: flog/method average

    10.0: User#chief_shops_for_month       -:2
</code></pre>

<h3 id="flog">Flog</h3>

<p>I use <a href="http://ruby.sadi.st/Flog.html">flog</a> to check complexity of my classes
and strive to keep the average complexity per method under 5:</p>

<pre><code>$ flog app
  1278.9: flog total
     5.0: flog/method average

    29.7: User#none
    23.7: TrHelper#tr                      app/helpers/tr_helper.rb:2
    21.0: Role#none
    ...
</code></pre>

<h2 id="service-class">Service class</h2>

<p>To me 10 flog per method is simply too much. We can try to break it down in two
methods like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  def chief_shops_for_month(month)
    shops.merge(chief_motivation_for_month(month).uniq
  end

  private

  def chief_motivation_for_month(month)
    motivations.for_month(month).where(role_id: Role.chief)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But this is ridiculous. It adds a private method on <code>User</code> that is calling god
knows what. Besides I don’t like the ‘Thin Controllers, Fat Models’ concept. As
a one-man operation there is simply not enough man-power to deal with ten feet
long models. My motto is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thin Everythin’!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I build service objects in a simple way. One public method <code>call</code> with
occasional parameters passed from controller (i.e. variables). Let’s extract
the query to a what a typical service object would look like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  class ChiefShopsForMonth
    attr_reader :user
    attr_reader :month

    def initialize(user)
      @user = user
    end

    def call(month)
      @month = month
      user.shops.merge(motivations_this_month_user_was_chief).uniq
    end

    private

    def motivations_this_month_user_was_chief
      user.motivations.for_month(month).where(role_id: Role.chief)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>We keep the <code>User</code> API unchanged so this is a true refactoring:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  def chief_shops_for_month(month)
    User::ChiefShopsForMonth.new(self).call
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>What <code>flog</code> has to say about this?</p>

<pre><code>   18.5: flog total
     4.6: flog/method average

     7.8: User::ChiefShopsForMonth#motivations_this_month_user_was_chief -:17
     6.7: User::ChiefShopsForMonth#call    -:10
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, this is better. Now it’s time to see if we can improve further and maybe make
it more functional-ish.</p>

<h3 id="the-talk">The talk</h3>

<p>This is the talk <a href="http://solnic.eu">Piotr Solnica</a> gave at Full-stack fest in 2015
that got me thinking about a better way of doing things.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMxurF4oqsc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The gist of it: Don’t store state. Just pass everything to <code>call</code> method
instead. That sounded interesting. Rolled up sleeves and here we go.</p>

<h2 id="refactoring-service-object">Refactoring Service object</h2>

<p>Let’s try with full head-on solution first. I would like to throw everything in
the mix:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dependency injection</li>
  <li>Command-query separation</li>
  <li>Keyword arguments (Smalltalk-style)</li>
  <li>Intention-revealing method names</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cqscqrs-command-query-responsibility-segregation">CQS/CQRS Command-Query Responsibility Segregation</h3>

<p>This is a simple principle that can be boiled down to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t modify and request data in the same method call</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or it can be put in another way, return <code>self</code> until the very last moment. That
allows chaining and storing the intermediate results and other interesting
things. The best examples in the wild I think are Rails scopes and JavaScript.
ActiveRecord Scopes can be chained up to the last moment where you can load the
relation into array by calling <code>to_a</code> on it. JavaScript is basically built on
returning <code>this</code>.  If you have ever used a JavaScript library like jQuery you
know the drill.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  class ChiefShopsForMonth
    def initialize(role = Role, motivation = Motivation)
      @role = role
      @motivation = motivation
    end

    def call(user:, month:)
      @user = user
      @role = role
      self
    end

    def shops
      all_user_shops.merge(chief_this_month).uniq
    end

    private

    attr_reader :user
    attr_reader :month
    attr_reader :role
    attr_reader :motivation

    def all_user_shops
      user.shops
    end

    def chief_this_month
      motivation.for_month(month).where(role_id: role.chief)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>While getting here it became obvious to me that I didn’t have to use
<code>user.motivation</code> as <code>merge</code> is taking care of this. And I think by relying on
<code>Motivation</code> class directly I can make it more intention-revealing, even if it
adds another dependency.</p>

<p>New structure gains certain tidiness in the upper part. Now <code>initialize</code> only
does dependency-injection for the whole object. Then <code>call</code> sets up the
parameters and returns <code>self</code> for chaining. You don’t have to return <code>self</code>,
but that gives you flexibility so I don’t see a reason not to add it. And
finally you can get the list of shops for the given month by calling <code>.shops</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  def chief_shops_for_month(month)
    User::ChiefShopsForMonth.new.call(user, month).shops
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Things get hairy however after the <code>private</code> mark. The state moved here
and there are four attributes instead of two. Flog is not very happy about this
either.  Average complexity per method is somewhat lower, but the total is even
higher.</p>

<pre><code>   26.0: flog total
     4.3: flog/method average

     7.6: User::ChiefShopsForMonth#chief_this_month -:30
     5.0: User::ChiefShopsForMonth#shops   -:15
     5.0: User::ChiefShopsForMonth#none
</code></pre>

<h2 id="stateless-object">Stateless Object</h2>

<p>One thing I would like to discuss first. As Sandi Metz says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can break the rules if you have a good reason or your pair lets you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>well, something along these lines at least.</p>

<p>So I claim that I don’t need to inject dependenices for other ActiveRecord
classes since they are not going to change. And if they will mist likely my
service will be deleted. Thus I can get rid of <code>initialize</code>. Of course in more
complex screnario this is not the best way to go, but this is a simple query
object so for the sake of refactoring experiment I think this will pass.</p>

<p>I think the rule of thumb here is similar to what Piotr is suggesting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Initialize with Service Objects you are depending on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since I am not changing anything here, apart from the inner state of the object
and I am getting rid of the state, I don’t need a separate method that returns
the result. That allows me to shrink object’s API to single <code>call</code> method.
Which is actually an improvement. Since now I don’t need to pass <code>user</code> and
<code>month</code> separately and they can go together as parameters in a single method
call.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  class ChiefShopsForMonth

    def call(user:, month:)
      all_user_shops(user).merge(chief_this_month(month)).uniq
    end

    private

    def all_user_shops(user)
      user.shops
    end

    def chief_this_month(month)
      Motivation.for_month(month).where(role_id: Role.chief)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see now state is not stored anywhere. Okay dependencies are not
injected which is a questionable practice. But again I claim in this case this
could pass.</p>

<p>The invocation is almost the same as with the previous example. The only
difference is that we don’t have to query for shops as this is a Query Object
so it only returns result straight away. And API is effectively shrunk to a
single method.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  def chief_shops_for_month(month)
    User::ChiefShopsForMonth.new.call(user: self, month: month)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Yes you have to call <code>new</code>, but only to instantiate an object. Or you can still
inject dependencies for testing. As a side effect we can pass a hash as
parameter. Piotr suggests to use value object. I think it is overkill here. I
could easily pass a params hash if I wanted to, but I am afraid it might hurt
readability. And now look at this:</p>

<pre><code>    10.4: flog total
     2.6: flog/method average

     5.0: User::ChiefShopsForMonth#call    -:4
     3.4: User::ChiefShopsForMonth#chief_this_month -:14
</code></pre>

<p>The whole class is almost as simple as the original single method in <code>User</code>. It
encapsulates everything it needs. It doesn’t pollute models with methods that
would never be used from other places. And has intention-revealing name and
simple single-method API.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>These are just some ideas on how to approach refactoring of fat models and fat
controllers. Please let me know if you think something could be improved.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
