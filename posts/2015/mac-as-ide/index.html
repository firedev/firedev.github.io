  <article class="mb3">
    <p>Are you using this editor and that version control app? Think bigger. Instead
of jumping between apps or forcing yourself to an IDE use your Mac as a system
where apps work together for the greater good.</p>

<p>The main idea is to use your environment as a single entity rather that a
collection of various application. Let me show you some tricks that help me
do the job. Basically it boils down to some simple concepts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Control everything from the keyboard.</li>
<li>Limit distractions.</li>
<li>Have a system behind the madness.</li>
</ul>

<p>I control eveything from keyboard: apps, windows. Is it faster and less
distracting if you don&#39;t have to reach for mouse. And this is something Windows
got right. Mac forces you to use mouse more often. It&#39;s not that much of a
problem if you are on Macbook. Trackpad is always within the reach, but still,
things could be better. Let&#39;s fix them.</p>

<h2>Keyboard Control</h2>

<p>First turn <code>Full Keyboard Access</code> to <code>Full Control</code> in <code>Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts</code>
pane of System Preferences.  Now we can switch between buttons and click
checkboxes in popup windows from keyboard. Not everybody knows that you can use
<code>Cmd-First letter of the button in popup</code> as well. So you can press <code>Cmd-D</code> to
choose <code>Don&#39;t Save</code> in Save Dialog.</p>

<p>Enable function keys to be used as such. You will have to press <code>Fn</code> along
with brightness and volume control but that will allow you easier reach for the
Menu bar we will hide next.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ide/function-keys.png" alt="Function Keys"></p>

<p>Hide dock with <code>Cmd-Opt-D</code> and the menu bar in <code>General &gt; Automatically hide
and show menu bar</code>. El Capitan allows us to use almost the whole screen estate
apart from the tiny bar at the edge of the screen where hidden Dock is located.
To quickly access Menu or to have a peek at the current time you can use
<code>Ctrl-F2</code> or <code>Cmd-?</code>. The help shortcut <code>Cmd-?</code> or <code>Cmd-Shift-/</code> opens help
menu from which you can search and execute menu items available in the app.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ide/full-keyboard-access.png" alt="Full Keyboard Access"></p>

<p>Additional shortcut to remember are: <code>Ctrl-F8</code> to reach application icons in
Menu if you need them. And, maybe, <code>Ctrl-F7</code> to toggle keyboard control back on
if you accidentally disable it.</p>

<h3>Finder</h3>

<p>Learn Finder&#39;s <code>Go</code> menu shortcuts. It will save you a ton of time and if you
are using <code>Cmd-Shift-G</code> to switch to a folder you can autocomplete paths using
<code>Tab</code>. I use <code>Documents</code>, <code>Desktop</code>, <code>Download</code> and <code>Connect to Server</code>
shortcuts all the time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ide/finder-go.png" alt="Finder Go Menu"></p>

<h3>Zoom</h3>

<p>Another semi-hidden option in OS X is full-screen zoom. Enable it in
<code>Acessibility &gt; Use scroll gesture to zoom</code>. Leave the keyboard modifier as
<code>Ctrl</code> and make sure <code>Zoom Style</code> is set to <code>Fullscreen Zoom</code>. Now you can zoom
in and out by scrolling while holding <code>Ctrl</code>. This is very useful if you need
to make sure the pixels are in place or to show something to a person across
the room.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ide/keyboard-zoom.png" alt="Keyboard Zoom"></p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to disable <code>Smooth images</code> as it blurs the zoomed in image and you can&#39;t
see individual pixels clearly.</p>

<h3>Seil and Karabiner</h3>

<p>I use these two tiny apps from the same developer for additional keyboard tricks.</p>

<p><a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karabiner</a> takes care of switching layouts
for me. I don&#39;t switch <em>between</em> layouts, I just press <code>Left Shift</code> for English and
<code>Right Shift</code> for Russian. So before writing code I just hit <code>Left Shift</code> and I
am sure I am using English. This is it.</p>

<p>Being a Vim user I have <code>Caps Lock</code> mapped to <code>Ctrl</code> in <code>Keyboard</code>.
<a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en">Seil</a> adds additional mapping to
<code>Caps Lock</code> so it serves both as <code>Ctrl</code> when held <em>and</em> as <code>Esc</code> when hit once.</p>

<h2>Window Management</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t minimize apps. I find this annoying. If there is too much clutter I
simply hide either current app via system shortcut <code>Cmd-H</code> or hide everything
else via <code>Cmd-Opt-H</code> (Hide Others). Some apps might need <code>Cmd-0</code> to show main window
after gaining focus back. If anything does not show up you can check in <code>Menu &gt;
Window</code> for the given app.</p>

<h3>SizeUp</h3>

<p>To control windows I am using
<a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/">SizeUp</a>. It allows me to size
windows to half, quarter, and full-screen. I move windows between screens and
center them so I can see a little bit behind around the edges of the screen.
There are many like it, but this one is the best tool for the job as I can do
everything without lifting hands from keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ide/size-up.png" alt="SizeUp Shortcuts"></p>

<p>I am a bit biased partly because of the involvement in development process (Hi,
Steve). But mostly because SizeUp out-of-the box comes with the most settings I
agree with. The only thing I am not content with is up arrow pointing to the
upper right corner. I still think it should be the upper left.</p>

<p>The only setting I change is 90x90% size for the <code>Center Window</code> and maybe
disabling <code>Move to Space</code> shortcuts.</p>

<p>Check their website for other tiny window management apps that offer slightly
different ways.</p>

<h3>BetterTouchTool</h3>

<p>And of course <a href="http://www.bettertouchtool.net/">BetterTouchTool</a>. This app is
indispensable. Without it the Trackpad would be only half as useful.</p>

<p>First thing to do is to free three-finger-swipes left and right for BTT. Open
<code>Trackpad</code> Preference Pane and change <code>Swipe between full-screen apps</code> to <code>Swipe with four fingers</code></p>

<p>Now we can put them to good use to switch between tabs for all applications.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ide/btt.png" alt="BetterTouchTool"></p>

<p>Some apps require special treatment so you would have to add them separately.
For instance I have <code>Cmd-Shift-[</code> and <code>Cmd-Shift-]</code> mapped for Safari.</p>

<p>It might be a bit tedious and I wish it had Dropbox sync. BTT can replace
SizeUp since it can do almost everything SizeUp does if not all. But entering a
dozen of shortcuts is not very fun task. This is why I am still using these two
apps together.</p>

<p>BetterTouchTool also add window snapping akin to Windows&#39; AeroSnap which is
pretty nice when you are feeling too lazy to reach the keyboard.</p>

<p>Usually I am putting windows side-by-side on a single screen. When I had two
monitors that were big enough and could be rotated vertically splitting each in
two part gave me four almost &quot;virtual&quot; screens.</p>

<p>None of these apps have Menu or Dock icons enabled. I am not the most organized
or efficient person so I hide and disable everything to limit distractions and
have tidier screen. If you need to access setting - launch the app again.</p>

<h3>EyeFriendly</h3>

<p>When there is not enough space on a single screen I launch
<a href="http://eye-friendly.com/">EyeFriendly</a>.  It has only two shortcuts assigned
that allow me to switch resolutions up and down. This is really useful if I
need to see what site I am working on looks like in bigger resolution. Or if
there is not enough space to put two apps side by side comfortably.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ide/eye-friendly.png" alt="EyeFriendly"></p>

<h2>App Switching</h2>

<p>As it is the case with keyboard layouts instead of switching <em>between</em> apps I
am switching straight <em>into</em> the app I need. That makes the computer feel as a
whole. I have identified the apps I use most and assigned shortcuts for them. I
have tried every Shortcut app imaginable, but only one supported Dropbox sync
out-of-the box.</p>

<h3>Alfred</h3>

<p>For many the trusty butler serves as replacement for Spotlight. And I do occasional
github searches from it as well. But other than that I find Spotlight pretty
adequate. <a href="http://alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> has another important functionality
sadly available only in pricey PowerPack -- Workflows.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ide/alfred.png" alt="Workflows"></p>

<p>I have tried different key combos and I think <code>Cmd-Ctrl</code> works best. So here
are the mnemonics</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Cmd-Ctrl-B</code> — Browser (Chrome)</li>
<li><code>Cmd-Ctrl-G</code> — Git (<a href="https://rowanj.github.io/gitx/">gitx-dev</a>)</li>
<li><code>Cmd-Ctrl-O</code> — <a href="http://omnigroup.com/">OmniFocus</a></li>
<li><code>Cmd-Ctrl-T</code> — Terminal (<a href="http://iterm2.com/">iTerm</a>)</li>
<li><code>Cmd-Ctrl-Q</code> — SQL (<a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a>)</li>
<li><code>Cmd-Ctrl-Z</code> — Messages. Kind of like Un-Do, get it?</li>
<li><code>Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-~..5</code> — To rate music in iTunes</li>
</ul>

<p>And <code>Space</code> which is much too powerful:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Cmd-Ctrl-Space</code> — Finder</li>
<li><code>Cmd-Shift-Space</code> — <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a></li>
<li><code>Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-Space</code> — Alfred, it can&#39;t go unassigned and I do occasional GitHub searches</li>
</ul>

<p><code>Space</code> is also my leader key in Vim and <code>Ctrl-Space</code> controls Tmux.</p>

<p>Here is a version of the <a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/app-shortcuts">App Shortcuts
Workflow</a> that comes preloaded
with some variants of apps (Sublime/Atom, iTerm/Terminal, Chrome/Safari) you
can use to build your own system.</p>

<p>Some other shortcuts are defined inside the apps that use them. I was
experimenting with double assignments so Alfred launches as app and then the
same shortcut activates the app function but it turned out to be not very
reliable.  So I have some shortcuts defined in the apps that are either
auto-started like NVAlt or that I use from time to time like Sip or
ColorSnapper before that:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Cmd-Ctrl-C</code> — Color (<a href="http://www.theolabrothers.com/">Sip</a>/<a href="http://colorsnapper.com/">ColorSnapper</a>)</li>
<li><code>Cmd-Ctrl-L</code> — Notational veLocity (<a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">NVAlt</a>), too bad it&#39;s not updated anymore.</li>
<li><code>Cmd-Esc</code> — iTerm again. This one toggles full screen terminal window.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have also had mappings for Textmate, Sublime and Atom, while trying to use them.
Switched to Vim since so everything is happening in terminal. I am using iTerm with
<code>General &gt; Lion Style Fullscreen</code> disabled. After that I can use <code>Cmd-Enter</code> for true
fullscreen mode I wish other apps had.</p>

<h2>Bonus</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s a cool trick that allows me to refresh Chrome without leaving the editor.
I have another shortcut in Alfred <code>Cmd-Opt-R</code> (that has a nice system-wide ring to it).
It launches this piece of AppleScript:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">on alfred_script(q)
  tell application &quot;Google Chrome&quot;
    reload active tab of (get window 1)
  end tell
end alfred_script
</code></pre></div>
<p>This little piece of code refreshes the current window in Google Chrome so you
don&#39;t have to switch focus.</p>

<p>It is especially useful if you have two screens so you can use one for editing
and refresh browser in another.</p>

<h2>Conlusion</h2>

<p>I hope that gives the idea how everything is tied together. I jump from Mail to
Terminal, <code>git fetch</code>, edit, jump to GitX, review changes, jump to browser,
open two apps side-by-side, edit in one window, see changes in another...</p>

<p>This approach also give you some modularity. If you don&#39;t like GitX, change it
to SourceTree. Don&#39;t like Sublime, change to Atom. You can replace and fine
tune individual parts of the system but still be sure when you press
<code>Cmd-Ctrl-T</code> you get to the terminal. Be it iTerm or Terminal or I don&#39;t know
what else.</p>

<p>So this is the staples of my day-to-day process. Please let me know if you
found anything useful and share some of your tricks.</p>
